## Technologies Used
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable components, making the code more modular and maintainable. React is responsible for rendering the user interface and managing the application state.
- **Redux:** A state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a predictable way to manage application state and ensures that state changes are consistent and can be easily tracked. In this application, Redux is used to manage the global state of the notes and lists, including their content, colors, and search terms.
- **Javascript:** The core programming language used to develop the application's logic and functionality. It interacts with both React and Redux to handle user interactions, data manipulation, and other operations.
